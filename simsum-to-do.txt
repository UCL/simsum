SIMSUM: JOBS

improve output format?
    (a) if m=1, output statistics as columns?
    (b) if no by-variable, output statistics as rows?
    (c) single table, so that column widths match

-> new option -transpose- (Sep2013) but fails without a by-variable

mean option would be nice (alternative to bias)

Method values must currently be valid variable names - change
