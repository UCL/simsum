simsum notes / to do
====================

NOT WORTH DOING BECAUSE THEY WILL BE DONE BY SIMAN:

10oct2019 (me): 
	update graph to modern graphics -> NO! STICK WITH QUICK AND DIRTY.

improve output format?
    (a) if m=1, output statistics as columns?
    (b) if no by-variable, output statistics as rows?
    (c) single table, so that column widths match
