simsum notes / to do
====================

Tim 25aug2021: allow multiple SEs for the same point estimate? e.g. a syntax in long format where you could specify one estimate variable and several SE variables, and then PMs like bias would report once but those like relerror once for each SE? 

NOT WORTH DOING BECAUSE THEY WILL BE DONE BY SIMAN:

10oct2019 (me): 
	update graph to modern graphics -> NO! STICK WITH QUICK AND DIRTY.

improve output format?
    (a) if m=1, output statistics as columns?
    (b) if no by-variable, output statistics as rows?
    (c) single table, so that column widths match
